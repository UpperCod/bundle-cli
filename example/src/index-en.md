## My Desing System

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to modify and share the application's database schema. Migrations are typically paired with Laravel's schema builder to build your application's database schema. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.

The Laravel Schema facade provides database agnostic support for creating and manipulating tables across all of Laravel's supported database systems.

### Summary

Each migration file name contains a timestamp, which allows Laravel to determine the order of the migrations. nulla Lorem officia et ea anim aute commodo deserunt irure excepteur anim elit esse velit cupidatat
